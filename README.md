# indietopia-internship-assignment
A project repository for Indietopia internship 1 week assignment.

# Timeline of design choices (with explanations)
Going further, I am going to use this markdown document to write out my choices and workflow during the creation of this project.

## Defining the problem/task

### Task
First I define a task based on the given assignment description. In this case the task is to **"Create a new project in Unity"** with key points being:
1. utilize external assets, your own assets -> develop a small scene with environmental storytelling in any appropriate topic of interest.
2. add a win condition -> pickups, player interactions, or checkpoints.

In addition to that, feedback in forms of visuals or sound is to be added upon completion.

### Task specifics
 - Project must be in a github repository.
 - Clean and easily understandable project structure and code.
