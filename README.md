# indietopia-internship-assignment
A project repository for Indietopia internship 1 week assignment.

# Timeline of design choices (with explanations)
Going further, I am going to use this markdown document to write out my choices and workflow during the creation of this project.

## Defining the problem/task

### Task
First I define a task based on the given assignment description. In this case the task is to **"Create a new project in Unity"** with key points being:
1. utilize external assets, your own assets -> develop a small scene with environmental storytelling in any appropriate topic of interest.
2. add a win condition -> pickups, player interactions, or checkpoints.

In addition to that, feedback in forms of visuals or sound is to be added upon completion.

### Task specifics
 - Project must be in a github repository.
 - Clean and easily understandable project structure and code.

## Idea definition
Since I am a movie fan I have decided to create this project by showing off my 3 favorite movies.

Each movie is dedicated a seperate room going from my third favorite to favorite.

1. Imitation Game
2. Dune
3. Interstellar

Above you can see the order of rooms themes I am going to try to create using publicly free assets.

Player will press a button next to the door to navigate to the next room.
Win condition is to walk through all the rooms and reach the final room.

## Specifications
I am going to use a mix of low and high poly assets from Unity Marketplace.
